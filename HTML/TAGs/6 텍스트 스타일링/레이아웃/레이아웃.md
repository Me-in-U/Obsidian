### [텍스트 정렬](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#%ED%85%8D%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8_%EC%A0%95%EB%A0%AC)

The [`text-align`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property is used to control how text is aligned within its containing content box. The available values are as follows, and work in pretty much the same way as they do in a regular word processor application:

- `left`: Left justifies the text.
- `right`: Right justifies the text.
- `center`: Centers the text.
- `justify`: Makes the text spread out, varying the gaps in between the words so that all lines of text are the same width. You need to use this carefully — it can look terrible, especially when applied to a paragraph with lots of long words in it. If you are going to use this, you should also think about using something else along with it, such as [`hyphens`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens), to break some of the longer words across lines.

If we applied `text-align: center;` to the [`<h1>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) in our example, we'd end up with this:

### [Line height](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#line_height)

The [`line-height` (en-US)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) property sets the height of each line of text — this can take most [length and size units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#length_and_size), but can also take a unitless value, which acts as a multiplier and is generally considered the best option — the [`font-size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) is multiplied to get the `line-height`. Body text generally looks nicer and is easier to read when the lines are spaced apart; the recommended line height is around 1.5–2 (double spaced.) So to set our lines of text to 1.5 times the height of the font, you'd use this:

```css
line-height: 1.5;
```
### [Letter and word spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#letter_and_word_spacing)

The [`letter-spacing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) and [`word-spacing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/word-spacing) properties allow you to set the spacing between letters and words in your text. You won't use these very often, but might find a use for them to get a certain look, or to improve the legibility of a particularly dense font. They can take most [length and size units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#length_and_size).

So as an example, if we applied the following to the first line of the [`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) elements in our example:

```css
p::first-line {
  letter-spacing: 2px;
  word-spacing: 4px;
}
```
